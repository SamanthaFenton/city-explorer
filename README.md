# City Explorer

**Author**: Samantha Fenton  
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview

To build an application for the user to explore more about other cities, including whats on, using asynchronous code and API's.

## Getting Started

This project will be devloped over the course of Module 02 of the Tech Educators 301-Coding programme. (To be entered are the steps to follow to develop this site.)

Follow the instructions detailed on my [Trello Board](https://trello.com/invite/b/xvmgugFQ/ATTIf800f24c118f131ceb9923dfc79a2259CA319B7E/city-explorer)

## Architecture

This is an exercise developed using REACT in JavaScript and jsx, introducing us to using API's, API keys, .env for storing sensitive information, .gitignore for storing hidden data stores such as the .env file, Query Parameters, Process env, async and await to define when a function executes ensuring a correct sequence, axios (libraries) and tri catch for handling of errors (wrapping the problem code to isolate the problem rather than the error affecting the whole code).
